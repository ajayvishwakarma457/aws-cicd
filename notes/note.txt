## SSH Login to AWS EC2 Instance

To log in to your AWS EC2 instance using SSH, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal in the project root directory.
2. Make sure your PEM file (`spak-prod-ap-south-1-ec2-key.pem`) has secure permissions:
	```sh
	chmod 400 spak-prod-ap-south-1-ec2-key.pem
	```
3. Use the following command to connect:
	```sh
	ssh -i "spak-prod-ap-south-1-ec2-key.pem" ubuntu@ec2-3-110-85-186.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com
	```

Replace `ubuntu` with the correct username if your instance uses a different OS (e.g., `ec2-user` for Amazon Linux).
